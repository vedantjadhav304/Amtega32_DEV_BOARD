⚙️ AVR Development Board for ATmega32 TQFP Version

Welcome to the official repository for the AVR Development Board for ATmega32 (TQFP Version)! This project aims to develop a cost-effective, reliable, and accessible development board specifically designed for the ATmega32 TQFP microcontroller. It addresses the challenges engineers, students, and hobbyists face in sourcing affordable and high-quality development platforms, particularly within the Indian market.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

The scarcity of affordable, reliable AVR development boards has created hurdles for developers working on embedded systems projects. With this in mind, we— Vedant Jadhav and Abhishek Patil —have embarked on a mission to create an affordable solution designed to simplify development for the ATmega32 TQFP version.

### This development board aims to offer:
- 💡 Cost-effectiveness without compromising quality, keeping in mind the Indian market's pricing and availability constraints.
- ⚡ Reliability to ensure the board meets the demands of various embedded systems projects.
- 🧩 A compact and space-saving design** for those needing a smaller form factor in their applications.

## ✨ Key Features

- 💰 Affordable Innovation: The board is designed to minimize costs while still offering high-quality components and performance.
- 📦 Locally Sourced Components: To address supply chain issues in India, we’ve carefully selected components that are easily available in the local market.
- 🖇️ Compact Design: The TQFP package allows for a smaller and more space-efficient board without sacrificing functionality.
- 🔧 Development-Friendly: Whether you’re prototyping or working on full-scale projects, this board simplifies the process for both engineers and hobbyists.
